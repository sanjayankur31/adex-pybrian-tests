AdEx-pybrian-tests
------------------

This repository just contains tests that I run on the AdEx neuron model `(Brett and Gerstner (2005))`_ to check the parameters given in `Naud et al. (2008)`_ using Brian2_

Please checkout the different branches - they contain code and graphs for the different behaviours.

The code and graphs are licensed under the WTFPL_ - do what you want with it.

Please note that Brian2 is not licensed as WTFPL.
